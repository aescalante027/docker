List of commands (docker -<cmd>)
run <image name> - runs Docker container with said image installed. Returns an error if image name does not exist.
version - returns version number of docker client

NOTE: Below requires sudo access (sudo docker -<cmd>)
attach <names OR container ID> - returns into interactive mode against target name or container ID. (NOTE: you may need
                                 to press enter again after execution to see command prompt.)
diff <container ID or name> - returns a diff of the current running container versus its stock image version available.
images - returns all docker images downloaded onto local machine
info - returns system level details and totals for docker on local machine
pause <container ID or name> - pauses the running target instance. 
ps - show all current running containers in Docker
ps -a - show all current and previous stopped docker containers 
pull <image name> - downloads image from Docker central
pull <image name>:<version num> - downloads image from Docker central using a particular version number
rm <container ID or name> - removes all data tied to a stopped instance by the target name or container ID.  
start <container ID or name> - starts the target container ID or name from a stopped state in Docker.
start <container ID or name> -a - starts the target container ID or name from a stopped state with terminal start in 
                                  Docker. 
stop <container ID or name> - stop the target container ID or name from running in Docker.
unpause <container ID or name> - unpause (or starts) previously paused Docker instance.    

Docker pull options:
-a - Downloads all versions of the particular image. WARNING: this option for downloading may cause a larger than usual 
     download.

Docker run options:
-i - makes container under “run” interactive by grabbing STDIN of the container. 
-p <machine port>:<vm port> - port forwards the vm port in the docker container to the machine port specified
    EXAMPLE: An nginx server, by default, runs on port 80. We can forward the port on our physical machine to port 8888
             so that we don't tie the actual port 80 with the container. By using -p 8888:80, we can still access nginx
             by using "localhost:8888". The container still runs nginx on port 80, but the docker client redirects this
             port to port 8888.
—-rm - informs docker to delete the container as soon as the instance is stopped automatically.
-t - adds pseudo terminal to the container under “run”
