List of commands (docker -<cmd>)

images: returns all docker images downloaded onto local machine

pull <image name>: downloads image from Docker central

OTHER:
sudo service docker status: 

Docker run options:
-p <machine port>:<vm port> - port forwards the vm port in the docker container to the machine port specified
    EXAMPLE: An nginx server, by default, runs on port 80. We can forward the port on our physical machine to port 8888
             so that we don't tie the actual port 80 with the container. By using -p 8888:80, we can still access nginx
             by using "localhost:8888". The container still runs nginx on port 80, but the docker client redirects this
             port to port 8888.
